# Floyd-s-Cycle-Finding-Algorithm-in-Linked-Lists
This post will demonstrate quite an efficient code to implement the Flyod's Cycle finding algorithm in N time in C.
This is just the code. So, for more information on the algorithm itself, visit this amazing post on twpointer techinque and this algo https://github.com/liyin2015/Algorithms-and-Coding-Interviews/blob/master/two_pointer.pdf.
Also, this code is a step by step implementation of this algo, right from entering the number of elements in the linked list to entering the elements, typing in the position at which the cycle needs to be created, printing the list with the cycle, then, finding out the start node(its data value, not the address; doesnot work for duplicates) to finally removing the cycle and printing out the original linked list.
This code doesnot work for linked lists without cycles, so its mandatory to enter the position at which the cycle needs to be created.
The interactive code will guide you through process. Feel free to edit any line to your liking. Thanks.
